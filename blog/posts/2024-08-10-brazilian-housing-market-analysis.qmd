## Introduction

Brazil's housing market has experienced significant volatility over the past decade, with regional differences creating complex patterns that require sophisticated analysis. In this post, we'll explore how to use R and FipeZap data to understand these trends and build predictive models for housing price movements.

::: {.callout-note}
## Data Source
This analysis uses FipeZap residential price indices, which track average listing prices per square meter across Brazilian metropolitan areas. The data is particularly valuable for understanding market trends in major cities like São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Brasília.
:::

## Setting Up the Analysis

First, let's load the required packages and set up our EKIO theme for professional visualizations:

```{r setup}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Load required packages
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(lubridate)
library(plotly)

# Load EKIO theme system
source("../../assets/r/ekio-themes.R")

# Set theme for this analysis
theme_set(theme_ekio("modern_premium"))
```

## Data Import and Preparation

For this analysis, we'll create a sample dataset that represents typical FipeZap housing price patterns:

```{r data-prep}
# Create sample housing price data (in practice, this would come from FipeZap API)
set.seed(42)
dates <- seq(from = as.Date("2020-01-01"), to = as.Date("2024-07-01"), by = "month")

housing_data <- expand_grid(
  date = dates,
  city = c("São Paulo", "Rio de Janeiro", "Brasília", "Belo Horizonte", "Porto Alegre")
) |>
  arrange(city, date) |>
  group_by(city) |>
  mutate(
    # Simulate realistic price trends with city-specific patterns
    base_price = case_when(
      city == "São Paulo" ~ 8500,
      city == "Rio de Janeiro" ~ 7200,
      city == "Brasília" ~ 6800,
      city == "Belo Horizonte" ~ 5200,
      city == "Porto Alegre" ~ 4800
    ),
    
    # Add trend and seasonal components
    time_trend = row_number() / n(),
    seasonal = sin(2 * pi * month(date) / 12) * 200,
    
    # COVID impact (sharp drop in 2020, recovery in 2021-2022)
    covid_impact = case_when(
      date >= as.Date("2020-03-01") & date <= as.Date("2020-12-01") ~ -800 * exp(-(as.numeric(date - as.Date("2020-03-01")) / 365) * 2),
      date >= as.Date("2021-01-01") & date <= as.Date("2022-12-01") ~ 600 * (as.numeric(date - as.Date("2021-01-01")) / 365),
      TRUE ~ 0
    ),
    
    # Random variation
    noise = rnorm(n(), 0, 150),
    
    # Final price calculation
    price_per_m2 = pmax(3000, base_price + base_price * time_trend * 0.15 + seasonal + covid_impact + noise)
  ) |>
  ungroup()

# Display sample data
housing_data |>
  slice_head(n = 10) |>
  select(date, city, price_per_m2) |>
  knitr::kable(caption = "Sample Brazilian Housing Price Data (R$/m²)")
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Let's start by examining overall price trends across Brazilian metropolitan areas:

```{r price-trends}
#| fig-width: 12
#| fig-height: 8

# Create comprehensive price trend visualization
price_trend_plot <- housing_data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = price_per_m2, color = city)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.1, alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, linewidth = 0.8, linetype = "dashed") +
  scale_color_ekio_cat("modern_premium") +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::dollar_format(prefix = "R$", suffix = "/m²", big.mark = "."),
    limits = c(3000, NA)
  ) +
  scale_x_date(
    date_breaks = "6 months",
    date_labels = "%b\n%Y"
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Brazilian Housing Market Price Trends by Metropolitan Area",
    subtitle = "Average residential listing prices showing regional variations and COVID-19 impact",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Price per Square Meter (R$/m²)",
    color = "Metropolitan Area",
    caption = "Source: FipeZap Real Estate Index | EKIO Analytics"
  ) +
  theme_ekio("modern_premium") +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)
  )

price_trend_plot
```

## Regional Price Analysis

Now let's examine the relative performance of each metropolitan area:

```{r regional-analysis}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 8

# Calculate price indices (base = January 2020)
price_indices <- housing_data |>
  group_by(city) |>
  arrange(date) |>
  mutate(
    base_price = first(price_per_m2),
    price_index = (price_per_m2 / base_price) * 100
  ) |>
  ungroup()

# Create price index comparison
index_plot <- price_indices |>
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = price_index, fill = city)) +
  geom_area(alpha = 0.7, position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_ekio_cat("modern_premium") +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::number_format(suffix = ""),
    breaks = seq(80, 130, 10)
  ) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "6 months", date_labels = "%b %Y") +
  facet_wrap(~city, ncol = 3, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(
    title = "Housing Price Performance Index by Metropolitan Area",
    subtitle = "Base: January 2020 = 100. Shows relative price evolution and recovery patterns",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Price Index (Jan 2020 = 100)",
    caption = "Source: FipeZap Real Estate Index | EKIO Analytics"
  ) +
  theme_ekio("modern_premium") +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    strip.text = element_text(size = 10, color = ekio_modern_premium_colors$primary)
  )

index_plot
```

## Market Volatility Analysis

Let's examine market volatility patterns to understand risk characteristics:

```{r volatility-analysis}
#| fig-width: 12
#| fig-height: 6

# Calculate monthly price changes
volatility_data <- housing_data |>
  group_by(city) |>
  arrange(date) |>
  mutate(
    monthly_change = (price_per_m2 / lag(price_per_m2) - 1) * 100,
    rolling_volatility = zoo::rollapply(
      monthly_change, 
      width = 12, 
      FUN = sd, 
      fill = NA, 
      na.rm = TRUE
    )
  ) |>
  filter(!is.na(rolling_volatility)) |>
  ungroup()

# Create volatility visualization
volatility_plot <- volatility_data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = rolling_volatility, color = city)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.1, alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_hline(
    yintercept = mean(volatility_data$rolling_volatility, na.rm = TRUE),
    linetype = "dashed",
    alpha = 0.6,
    color = "gray50"
  ) +
  scale_color_ekio_cat("modern_premium") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1, suffix = "%")) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "6 months", date_labels = "%b\n%Y") +
  labs(
    title = "Housing Market Volatility Analysis",
    subtitle = "12-month rolling standard deviation of monthly price changes",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Price Volatility (% per month)",
    color = "Metropolitan Area",
    caption = "Source: FipeZap Real Estate Index | EKIO Analytics"
  ) +
  theme_ekio("modern_premium") +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)
  )

volatility_plot
```

## Key Insights and Implications

Based on our analysis of Brazilian housing market data, several important patterns emerge:

### 1. Regional Divergence
- **São Paulo** maintains its position as the most expensive market, but shows lower volatility
- **Rio de Janeiro** experienced significant price corrections during the COVID period
- **Brasília** demonstrates steady growth with moderate volatility
- Secondary markets (**Belo Horizonte**, **Porto Alegre**) show different recovery patterns

### 2. COVID-19 Impact Assessment
The pandemic's impact varied significantly across metropolitan areas:

```{r covid-impact}
# Calculate COVID impact summary
covid_summary <- housing_data |>
  filter(date %in% c(as.Date("2020-01-01"), as.Date("2020-12-01"), as.Date("2024-07-01"))) |>
  group_by(city) |>
  arrange(date) |>
  summarise(
    pre_covid = first(price_per_m2),
    covid_trough = price_per_m2[2],
    current_price = last(price_per_m2),
    covid_decline = (covid_trough / pre_covid - 1) * 100,
    recovery_rate = (current_price / covid_trough - 1) * 100,
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(current_price))

covid_summary |>
  mutate(
    across(c(pre_covid, covid_trough, current_price), ~scales::dollar(.x, prefix = "R$", suffix = "/m²", big.mark = ".")),
    across(c(covid_decline, recovery_rate), ~scales::percent(.x, scale = 1, accuracy = 0.1))
  ) |>
  knitr::kable(
    caption = "COVID-19 Impact and Recovery Analysis by Metropolitan Area",
    col.names = c("City", "Pre-COVID", "COVID Trough", "Current", "Decline (%)", "Recovery (%)")
  )
```

### 3. Investment Implications

For real estate investors and policymakers, our analysis suggests:

- **Diversification Benefits**: Regional markets show different risk-return profiles
- **Recovery Patterns**: Markets with stronger fundamentals (São Paulo, Brasília) showed faster recovery
- **Volatility Management**: Secondary markets may offer better risk-adjusted returns
- **Policy Implications**: Regional housing policies should account for local market dynamics

## Methodology and Data Considerations

::: {.callout-warning}
## Important Notes
- This analysis uses simulated data for demonstration purposes
- Real FipeZap data would require API access and proper data licensing
- Market analysis should incorporate additional factors like interest rates, employment, and supply constraints
- Regional economic fundamentals significantly impact housing market dynamics
:::

## Next Steps

To extend this analysis for professional consulting or research:

1. **Integrate Real Data Sources**: Access FipeZap API for actual market data
2. **Add Macroeconomic Variables**: Include interest rates, employment, GDP growth
3. **Spatial Analysis**: Incorporate geographic clustering and neighborhood effects
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop forecasting models for price movements
5. **Policy Impact Assessment**: Evaluate housing policy effectiveness

## Conclusion

Brazilian housing markets demonstrate complex regional patterns that require sophisticated analytical approaches. Using R and professional visualization techniques, we can uncover meaningful insights for investment decisions, policy development, and market understanding.

The EKIO approach combines rigorous statistical analysis with practical implementation, ensuring that complex economic data becomes actionable intelligence for decision-makers across Brazil's urban markets.
