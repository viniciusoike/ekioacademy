### Regional Economic Patterns
Brazil's economic development shows persistent regional disparities, with the Southeast maintaining its dominance while the Northeast shows signs of convergence in specific sectors.

### Inflation Heterogeneity
Regional price levels vary significantly, with transportation costs and housing driving much of the geographic variation in living costs.

### Productivity Challenges
Manufacturing productivity growth has stagnated since 2010, while service sectors show more dynamic patterns across different metropolitan areas.
