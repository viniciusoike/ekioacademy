## Visualization Strengths

This horizontal stacked percentage chart demonstrates **Nexo's clean approach to demographic analysis** through its **dual-color encoding system** that makes gender disparities immediately apparent across age groups. The **teal and dark blue color scheme** provides strong contrast while maintaining professional aesthetics, and the **percentage labels within bars** eliminate the need for complex legends or external reference points.

The visualization reveals a striking demographic pattern: **the gender gap in driver's licenses widens significantly with age**, from nearly equal representation among young adults (18-30: 62.7% male) to dramatic disparities among seniors (71+: 77.4% male). The **horizontal bar orientation** accommodates age group labels effectively while the **consistent 100% scaling** enables immediate cross-group comparisons.

## Key Learning Points

- **Horizontal stacked percentage bars** excel at showing compositional changes across categories
- **Age-based analysis** reveals generational differences in transportation access and behavior
- **Gender encoding through color** makes disparities immediately visible without requiring complex legends
- **Percentage labeling within bars** maintains chart cleanliness while preserving precision
- **Demographic visualization** techniques help identify societal patterns and potential policy implications
- This replication teaches both population analysis and effective demographic data presentation
