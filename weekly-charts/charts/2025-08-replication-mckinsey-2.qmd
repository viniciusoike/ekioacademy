## Visualization Strengths

This sophisticated bubble chart showcases **McKinsey's premium visualization approach** through its **three-dimensional data encoding**: job factors (rows), countries (columns), and age groups (bubble colors). The **blue gradient color scheme** effectively distinguishes age cohorts while maintaining professional consistency. The **grid-based layout** creates natural comparison zones both horizontally (across countries) and vertically (across job factors).

The visualization reveals that **remuneration dominates** as the primary job change driver across all European countries, with remarkable consistency. The **bubble size consistency** focuses attention on the percentage values rather than creating false hierarchies, while the **strategic factor ordering** places the most important drivers at the top.

## Key Learning Points

- **Bubble charts** excel at showing three dimensions of data simultaneously
- **Grid layouts** facilitate both row-wise and column-wise comparisons
- **Monochromatic color gradients** work well for ordered categorical data (age groups)
- **Consistent bubble sizing** prevents visual distortion of the underlying data
- **Strategic variable ordering** (highest to lowest importance) guides reader attention
- This replication teaches advanced ggplot2 techniques for complex multi-dimensional data
