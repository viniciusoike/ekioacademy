![Brazil Housing Price Growth 2019-2024](../../assets/images/weekly-charts/housing-prices-2025.png){fig-alt="Chart showing housing price growth across Brazilian metropolitan areas from 2019-2024, with SÃ£o Paulo leading at 142% growth, followed by Rio de Janeiro at 128%, and other major cities. A comparison line shows median income growth at only 42% over the same period."}

## Key Insights

**127%** - Average housing price increase in Brazil's 12 largest metropolitan areas since 2019

**42%** - Median household income growth over the same period

**85 pp** - Gap between housing cost and income growth, creating unprecedented affordability crisis

## What This Means

The dramatic divergence between housing prices and income growth represents the most severe housing affordability crisis in Brazil's modern history. This trend is:

- **Concentrating wealth** among existing property owners
- **Excluding young professionals** from homeownership
- **Driving migration** to smaller cities with more affordable housing
- **Creating political pressure** for expanded government housing programs

## Next Week

We'll examine which cities are bucking this trend and what policy interventions might help restore housing affordability.
