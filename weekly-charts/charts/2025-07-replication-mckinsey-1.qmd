## Visualization Strengths

This stacked bar chart masterfully demonstrates **McKinsey's signature visual style** through its clean typography, strategic color choices, and sophisticated layout. The **bold black and cyan color contrast** creates immediate visual hierarchy while the **integrated text annotations** eliminate the need for traditional legends or axes.

The chart reveals a striking pattern: **women's representation remains remarkably stable** at ~29% across all seniority levels in Nigeria's private sector, from entry-level to C-suite positions. This consistency contradicts the typical "leaky pipeline" narrative often seen in corporate gender studies.

## Key Learning Points

- **Integrated annotations** work better than traditional axis labels for executive presentations
- **Stacked bars with percentage splits** clearly show compositional data across categories
- **Strategic color choices** (black/cyan) create professional contrast while maintaining readability
- **Minimal grid lines** focus attention on data rather than chart infrastructure
- This replication teaches both gender analytics and McKinsey-style visualization techniques

*Data: McKinsey survey conducted Marâ€“June 2024. Replication demonstrates ggplot2 stacked bar techniques with professional styling.*
