## Visualization Strengths

This stacked bar chart excels at showing **compositional differences** across religious groups through consistent 100% scaling. The **three-shade blue color palette** creates clear age group distinctions while maintaining visual harmony. The **strategic ordering** places Muslims at the top to emphasize the title's main finding about their younger demographic profile.

The chart's **horizontal layout** accommodates longer category labels comfortably, while **percentage labels inside bars** provide precise values without external clutter. Notice how the **consistent bar width** focuses attention on proportional differences rather than absolute population sizes.

## Key Learning Points

- **Stacked bars** are ideal for showing part-to-whole relationships across categories
- **Monochromatic color schemes** with varying saturation work well for ordered data (age groups)
- **Strategic category ordering** can reinforce the narrative (youngest populations first)
- **Internal labeling** maintains clean chart boundaries while preserving precision
- This replication technique teaches both demographic analysis and professional chart styling
