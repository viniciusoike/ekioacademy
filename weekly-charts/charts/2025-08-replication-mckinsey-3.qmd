## Visualization Strengths

This sophisticated **three-panel dashboard** exemplifies **McKinsey's premium multi-dimensional storytelling approach**, building on their reputation as the global standard for management consulting visualizations. The dashboard demonstrates McKinsey's **coordinated visualization strategy** - each panel tells part of a comprehensive story about commerce media's explosive growth trajectory.

The **left panel's exponential line chart** establishes the dramatic growth narrative ($40B to $100B), while the **middle panel's stacked bars** show increasing market penetration (12% to 22% of ad spend), and the **right panel's simple bars** reveal the emerging opportunity in gross merchandise value (0.6% to 1.3%). McKinsey's **strategic use of blue accent color** creates visual cohesion while their **clean typography hierarchy** ensures each insight is immediately accessible.
