## Visualization Strengths

This horizontal bar chart masterfully demonstrates **Folha SP's clean editorial style** through its strategic use of a **two-color legend system** that immediately distinguishes between family types. The **graduated blue color scheme** creates visual hierarchy while the **right-aligned percentage labels** provide precise affordability values without cluttering the visualization.

The chart reveals a striking pattern: **República leads in affordability** for single residents at 80.1%, but family housing shows dramatic variation across São Paulo neighborhoods. The **clear categorical separation** between high-affordability areas (darker blue) and lower-affordability areas (lighter blue) makes the housing inequality immediately apparent.

## Key Learning Points

- **Horizontal bars** excel for categorical data with longer neighborhood names
- **Two-color legends** work effectively when comparing two distinct groups
- **Strategic color gradation** helps distinguish data categories while maintaining visual coherence
- **Right-aligned labels** keep charts clean while preserving numerical precision
- This replication teaches both housing analysis and Brazilian media visualization standards
