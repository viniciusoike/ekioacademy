**0.4** - Cars per household in peripheral areas like Cidade Tiradentes and Capão Redondo

**4x** - Difference between highest and lowest car ownership areas

## The Surprising Pattern

São Paulo's car ownership reveals an expected wealth gradient - but with a twist. While peripheral low-income areas predictably have low car ownership, **the historic downtown also mirrors these patterns** despite its central location.

This suggests that:
- **Urban density** and transit access can substitute for private vehicles
- **Historic downtown residents** may prioritize proximity over car ownership
- **Car-centric development** in wealthy suburbs drives higher ownership rates

## Policy Implications

The data supports transit-oriented development policies, showing that well-connected central areas can maintain low car dependency regardless of proximity to jobs and services.
