![Car Ownership Rates Across São Paulo](../../assets/images/weekly-charts/sp-car-ownership-map.png){fig-alt="Choropleth map of São Paulo showing car ownership rates per household by Origin-Destination survey zones. Wealthy central neighborhoods like Pacaembu and Jardim Europa show dark green (1.4-1.6 cars/household) while peripheral areas show light colors (0.2-0.4 cars/household). The historic downtown also shows surprisingly low ownership rates."}

## Key Insights

**1.6** - Cars per household in wealthy neighborhoods like Jardim Europa and Alto de Pinheiros

**0.4** - Cars per household in peripheral areas like Cidade Tiradentes and Capão Redondo  

**4x** - Difference between highest and lowest car ownership areas

## The Surprising Pattern

São Paulo's car ownership reveals an expected wealth gradient - but with a twist. While peripheral low-income areas predictably have low car ownership, **the historic downtown also mirrors these patterns** despite its central location.

This suggests that:
- **Urban density** and transit access can substitute for private vehicles
- **Historic downtown residents** may prioritize proximity over car ownership
- **Car-centric development** in wealthy suburbs drives higher ownership rates

## Policy Implications

The data supports transit-oriented development policies, showing that well-connected central areas can maintain low car dependency regardless of proximity to jobs and services.
