## Visualization Strengths

This time series effectively combines **multiple visual elements** to tell a complex story about transportation recovery. The **annotated timeline** uses vertical lines and labels to mark key events (station openings, pandemic period, fare increases), while the **trend line overlay** helps distinguish long-term patterns from monthly volatility.

The **shaded pandemic period** immediately contextualizes the dramatic ridership drop, while **strategic color contrast** (yellow line, gray background) maintains the metro line's brand identity. The **dual y-axis approach** allows comparison of absolute numbers with trend direction.

## Key Insights

- **Post-pandemic recovery remains incomplete** with weekday ridership still 10% below pre-pandemic levels
- **Weekend recovery is stronger** (only 3.6% below), suggesting leisure travel returned faster than commuting
- **New station openings** show limited impact on overall ridership trends
- **Fare increases** may have dampened recovery momentum, though causation requires further analysis

## Key Learning Points

- **Annotated timelines** effectively show cause-and-effect relationships in longitudinal data
- **Trend lines** help separate signal from noise in volatile monthly data
- **Contextual shading** (pandemic period) provides essential historical framework
