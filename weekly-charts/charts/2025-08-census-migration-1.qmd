## Visualization Strengths

This horizontal bar chart effectively displays migration data by using **proportional bar lengths** that make volume comparisons immediate and intuitive. The **clean typography** and **consistent teal color scheme** maintain focus on the data while the **right-aligned numbers** provide precise values without cluttering the visualization.

The chart reveals that **Florianópolis leads significantly** with over 84,000 Rio Grande do Sul migrants, nearly double the second-place Chapecó. This pattern shows how **major urban centers** and **border cities** attract different migration flows - Florianópolis as a capital city destination versus Chapecó's proximity advantage.

## Key Learning Points

- **Horizontal bars excel** for categorical data with long labels (city names)
- **Single color schemes** work well when comparing within one category
- **Strategic ordering** (highest to lowest) immediately highlights leaders and patterns
- This approach scales well for showing migration flows between specific regions

*Data: IBGE Census 2022. Chart shows cities with highest absolute numbers of gaúcho emigrants.*
