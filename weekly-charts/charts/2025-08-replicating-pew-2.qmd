## Visualization Strengths

This chart replication demonstrates excellent **hierarchical visual design** with the callout box drawing attention to the most striking finding - the dramatic 53% decline in starter homes under 1,400 sq ft. The **dual-color approach** (dark bars for 2023, light bars for 2004) creates immediate temporal comparison across all size categories.

The **clean typography** and **strategic whitespace** mirror Pew Research's professional style, while the **left-aligned category labels** maintain readability even with varying text lengths. Notice how the **proportional bar widths** make the magnitude differences clear - larger homes show smaller percentage changes.

## Key Learning Points

- **Callout boxes** effectively highlight key insights without cluttering the main visualization
- **Consistent color encoding** across categories reduces cognitive load for readers
- **Professional styling** (fonts, spacing, alignment) significantly impacts credibility and readability
- This replication approach helps students understand both data analysis and visual design principles
